Hasan Arthur Altuntaş
😂 Hello World!

Hey there! I'm Hasan Arthur, a code-slinging, meme-loving developer who believes programming should be as fun as a Doge meme. When I'm not busy training AI models or squashing bugs, you'll find me dropping internet references and saying “much wow” at my own code. (I also play piano and compose music – because why limit creativity to just coding?)

🤖 Coding & Comedy

Sometimes I tackle a project with pure Gigachad energy. No bug is safe; no algorithm is too daunting. In those moments, I'm coding like an absolute unit, optimizing everything and flexing my brain muscles (big galaxy brain vibes).

Then reality hits... and suddenly I'm this dog at the keyboard with no idea what I'm doing! Whether it's a mysterious bug at 3 AM or a deployment that decided to go haywire, I embrace the absurdity and keep going. The good news: I always come out the other side wiser (and with a few more memes in my arsenal).

🥽 Welcome to the Meme-verse

In my world, code can be as mesmerizing as falling green Matrix code. I sometimes imagine I'm Neo (minus the trench coat) seeing patterns in the digital rain. That whole hacker-in-a-neon-room aesthetic? Totally my vibe.

I'm also inspired by the wacky science of Rick & Morty – where absurd humor meets genius ideas. If a project gets unpredictable or chaotic, I just chalk it up as another portal adventure. In the end, creativity and curiosity drive me, whether I'm in a multiverse or a codebase.

🚀 Let's Connect & Collaborate

Are you a fellow meme connoisseur or have an epic project idea? Hit me up! I love meeting new people and building cool stuff together.
